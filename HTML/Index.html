            He first gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation (2001-2007); intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape Room for Improvement.

            <p>Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200.
              He achieved back-to-back widespread critical successes with his next two albums Take Care (2011) and Nothing Was the Same (2013).
              Drake's first commercial mixtape If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015) earned a platinum certification in the US.
              His fourth album Views (2016) sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over a decade.
              Marketed as a playlist, Drake's third commercial mixtape More Life (2017) set multiple streaming records.
              A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which produced three number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100.
              Drake's fourth commercial mixtape Dark Lane Demo Tapes (2020) featured the Hot 100 number-one lead single "Toosie Slide".

              In 2016, Drake was announced as the new "global ambassador" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise.
              In the same year, Drake announced his development with American entrepreneur Brent Hocking of the bourbon whiskey Virginia Black; it eventually broke sale records in Canada.
              In 2018, Drake was reportedly responsible for 5% (CAD$440 million) of Toronto's CAD$8.8 billion total annual tourism income.</p>
